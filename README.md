This repository will be used for the '4th Project: Musical Structure App.'

## Project Overview
> This project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned so far in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making the structure of a music app using Intents, New Activities, Arraylists, Loops and Custom Classes.  
The goal is to design and layout the flow for the structure of a Music Player app. Note that for this project, the app does not actually need to play music.  
There are many music player apps, and they employ a wide variety of design choices. It will be your job to decide on the kind of structure that you would like your music app to have and build that structure using intents. Will you build an app to play music from the userâ€™s library of music? Will you build an app to stream random songs from a database? Will you build a musical suggestion engine? Those choices are up to you!

## Suggested App Ideas
- "Now playing" screen
- List artists, albums, playlists, or podcasts
- Detail screen or screens for individual artists, albums, or podcasts
- Store screen for buying music online
- Search screen

## Requirements
- Designing an app experience to achieve a certain goal
- Creating new activities
- Using explicit Intents to link between activities in your app
- Using OnClickListeners to add behavior to buttons using Java code.
- Creating your own Custom Class
- Looping through an ArrayList
- Populating a ListView or GridView with an ArrayAdapter
